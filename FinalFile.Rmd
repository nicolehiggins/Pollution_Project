Mod: To start with, where is air pollution concentrated in both countries?


```{r}
ggmap(india)+
geom_point(data = india_city_pollution2 %>% filter(Pollutant == "AQI", year == "2020"),
           aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = degree_pollution))+
theme(legend.background = element_blank(),
      legend.position = "bottomright")+
labs(title = "AQI of Indian Cities in 2020")  
  theme_map()
```
Mod: How has this changed over time?

```{r}
india_city_pollution %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = AQI, color = City)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(vars(City)) +
  labs(title = "Air Quality Index in Major Indian Cities from 2015-2020")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Mod: Does the composition of air pollution change over time too? What does this indicate?

```{r}
india_pollutants<-
  india_city_pollution2 %>% 
  group_by(month,Pollutant, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_monthly = mean(degree_pollution)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_monthly, fill = Pollutant))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Pollutants over time in India",
       subtitle = "Pollutant:{closest_state}",
       y = "Monthly Average",
       x = "")+
  transition_states(Pollutant)

anim_save("pollution_over_time.gif", india_pollutants)  
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("pollution_over_time.gif")
```

Are there any trends you notice that might indicate certain causes for the pollution in these countries?

```{r}
pollution_season<-
india_city_pollution2 %>% 
  filter(Pollutant!="AQI") %>% 
  group_by(month,Pollutant, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_monthly = mean(degree_pollution)) %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = mean_monthly), position = position_stack())+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Pollutant))+
  labs(title = "Pollution by Season in India",
       x = "",
       y = "Monthly Average")+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma")

ggplotly(pollution_season,
         tooltip = c("text", "y"))
```

```{r}

    bbox = c(left = 61.188, bottom = 8.026, right = 106.542, top = 36.502), 
    maptype = "toner-lite",
    zoom = 5)
    
ggmap(india) +
  geom_point(data = india_factory_pollution,
             aes(x = Long, y = Lat, size = `Number of Factories - 2014-15` ))+
  labs(title = "Number of Factories in 2015 in Indian States",
       x = "",
       y = "")
